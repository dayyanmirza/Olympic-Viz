# Olympic Team Performance Bump Chart Visualisation

This project is a data visualisation of Olympic data using D3.js. The visualisation loads data from a CSV file and is displayed in the browser.

## How to Run

To view the visualisation:

1. Ensure you have the following files in the project directory:
    - `bump_data_decade.csv` (processed data file)
    - `index.html` (HTML file for the visualisation)
    - `script.js` (JavaScript file for the visualisation logic)

2. Open the `index.html` file using a local web server. This is necessary to avoid browser security restrictions on `file://` paths. For example:
    - Use the "Live Server" extension in your IDE.
